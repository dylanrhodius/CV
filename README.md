# Dylan Rhodius

I'm a junior full-stack web developer who is particularly keen on learning more about mobile software development and good UX Design. I believe mobile is the future – and I want in.

Makers has instilled in me the value of good coding practices, and I can confidently say that I always try to craft testable and maintainable code. You can count on me to give as much importance to developing solid back-ends as well as beautiful front-ends. I believe my [background in engineering & product design](http://dylanrhodius.wixsite.com/dylanrhodius) and [Makers projects](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/CV#projects) are a testament to this. I'm committed to adding value to the team by contributing a hardworking, can-do mindset and a collaborative attitude from day one.

After one of the most intense and rewarding 3 months of my life, I'm now looking to join a hardworking and creative environment that will challenge me to push my abilities to the next level. A place where agile, test driven development and pair programming are common practice.

## Projects


| Project Repo & Demo  | Description | Technologies | Struggled with | Enjoyed |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
|[Pixos Repo](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/Pixos)<br>**[Demo on Heroku](https://pixos.herokuapp.com/)** | A card game inspired on GWENT from The Witcher 3. | MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Redux, Socket.io, Passport, Webpack, Material UI, Bootstrap, Sass. **Testing:** Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Enzyme.  | The complexity of our project did not allow us to plan everything upfront. Learning Redux and Socket.io.  | Managing to build an awesome app. Remaining agile in order to achieve all the objectives we set at the beginning of the project. |
|[Steami Repo](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/Steami)<br>**[Demo on Heroku](https://steami.herokuapp.com/)** | A single page Javascript web app that allows the user to connect via their Steam account. It then displays general information about their account and specific information about each game the user owns. | MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Passport, Webpack, Bootstrap, Sass. **Testing:** Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Enzyme.  | Having to learn many new technologies from scratch in a very limited timeframe. | Successfully building an awesome app whilst getting the opportunity to learn technologies I was particularly interested in - all of it in one week only! |
|[MakersBnB Repo](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/MakersBnB-challenge)<br>**[Demo on Heroku](https://mabnb.herokuapp.com/)** | A clone of AirBnB. This project was carried out as a team of 4 within 1 week. | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Javascript, Bootstrap. **Testing:** RSpec, Capybara. | It was my first time learning front-end technologies. These were relatively challenging at first but loads of fun. | Carrying out the first team project in Makers and being free to completely self-organise each other as a team. |


## Skills

#### Enthusiastic & Eager to Learn
The way in which we work is defined by our personality. Constantly seeking and highlighting the positive aspects of life, my approach to projects is invariably imbued with a sense of optimism and a can-do attitude. This was particularly evident when going beyond what is taught at Makers, my team and I decided to learn how to create a MERN stack app by ourselves in only one week. The project went so well that the team I joined the following week for another project was also persuaded to create a MERN stack app. I'm a firm believer that anything can be achieved with the right mindset.

#### Team-player
When pairing or during a team project, I always strive to identify the best dynamics in which my peers and I can get the best out of each other. Be it offering direction or supporting others to take the lead, my main motivation is to accomplish our objectives together.  I get a great sense of satisfaction when successfully adapting to the situation at hand to maximise our efforts and learning. Throughout my time at Makers, coaches and colleagues have appreciated my ability to bring the best out of my pair and learn from one another.

#### Good Communicator
I'm fortunate to have grown-up in different countries. This meant having to adapt to new environments, social conventions and languages often. This has helped me to hone my communication skills and to always aim to explain complex concepts in simple terms. I always take the opportunity to challenge my understanding on a topic by explaining it to my peers. As the Feynman technique proposes: if we want to understand something well, we need to be able to explain it simply.
